Description: This package contains necessary functions to reproduce the simulation experiments of the article Arlot and Genuer (XXXX). In this article the rate of convergence of Hold-Out Random Forests bias is studied. Thus, the package gives an implementation of this Random Forests variant and a plot function to visualize the bias convergence rate of trees v.s. forests.
